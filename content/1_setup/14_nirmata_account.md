### Activating Account

After registering for an account, the user should receive an email with instructions on how to activate their account. If an email is not received, check your spam filters or other processes that could be blocking this email. If all that does not resolve the issue, contact [Nirmata Customer Support](https://nirmata.com/contact-us).

If the activation email is received, click the **Activate Account** button.

This will open a web browser and take the user to a Nirmata page in order to create the userâ€™s initial password. Supply a password meeting or exceeding the requirements listed on the page.
