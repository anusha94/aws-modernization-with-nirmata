## Account Provisioning

Visit [nirmata.io](https://nirmata.io/security/signup.html) and register for a trial account.

## Activating Account

After registering for an account, the user should receive an email with instructions on how to activate their account. If an email is not received, check your spam filters or other processes that could be blocking this email. If all that does not resolve the issue, contact [Nirmata Customer Support](https://nirmata.com/contact-us).

If the activation email is received, click the button for Activate Account.

This will open a web browser and take the user to a Nirmata page in order to create the user’s initial password. Supply a password meeting or exceeding the requirements listed on the page.

### Getting Started with Clusters

After the user account is fully activated, it’s now time to begin to configure the Kubernetes clusters that NPM will be working with. On the opening screen, there is an introduction page explaining what NPM looks to accomplish. There are two buttons at the bottom of the page. One listed as See Features and the other listed as Get Started.

For the purposes of this tutorial, click the **Get Started** button.

The next page will list out the steps that will need to be completed. This includes installing the Nirmata Controller, connecting the cluster to NPM and then working with the systems within the framework, by monitoring the cluster details and policy violations.
